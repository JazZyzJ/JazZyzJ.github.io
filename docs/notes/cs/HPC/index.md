# HPC learning notes

!!! abstract 
    This is a collection of notes on high performance computing.
    I took a course called HPC101 in the summer of 2024, maybe I'll not work on HPC in the future, but I'll keep these notes for reference.
    BTW HPC101 is definitely a good course, and I wanted to gain something from it so I took these notes.
